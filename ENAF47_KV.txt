Song and Dance to Delight the Ḍākas and Ḍākinīs: An Aspiration for the Sixfold Satisfaction of the Feast Gathering Maṇḍalas of deities emanating from samādhi Are satisfied through cloudbanks of offerings, outer and inner, Within undefiled great bliss-through the power of this, May we complete the two accumulations of merit and wisdom! On the blossoming lotus in the center of my heart, My own mind is inseparable from the guru and yidam- Through the blessing of satisfying them with wisdom nectar, May all dualistic grasping and deluded thought be securely bound! All the hosts of Dharma protectors and worldly spirits Are satisfied with the torma of appetizing food and drink, Which is like a swirling ocean of many kinds of sensory delights- Through this, may the activity of dispelling all obstacles be accomplished! May the yogis who have received the ripening empowerments and who abide by the three vows, Be satisfied through the gaṇacakra, The samaya of partaking of special food and drink, And may they always enjoy the sustenance of samādhi! With the sensory deities satisfied through vajra songs and dance, And the music of bliss and emptiness, May whatever arises dawn as pure perception In which deity and primordial wisdom are one! Through constant satisfaction in the supreme, coemergent wisdom In which all things arise as great bliss, May we gain the siddhi of mahāmudrā, Within the all-encompassing bindu in which saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are inseparable! In short, through the power of delighting every level Of all outer and inner maṇḍalas with this undefiled feast, May the light of auspiciousness, of sublime and worldly goodness, Suffuse the three planes of existence! These words arose from the ocean-like mind of the one named Zhönu Khyentse.
